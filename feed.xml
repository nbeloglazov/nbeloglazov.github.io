      <title>Clojure Google Summer of Code Results</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Google Summer of Code is over and here is a summary of great work Clojure students have done this summer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Student: Aleksandr Sorokoumov&lt;br&gt;
Project: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2014/gerrrr/5693417237512192&quot;&gt;Incanter and core.matrix integration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I introduced core.matrix as a martix backend for Incanter, instead of clatrix (one of the core.matrix backends). This resulted in a possibility to choose the most appropriate matrix backend for the particular project and transparently switch between them if necessary. Besides, Incanter dataset implementation was replaced by core.matrix one. Due to this, most of the dataset functions are available through core.matrix without a need to install Incanter. More details about Incanter changes can be found in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/incanter/incanter/wiki/Incanter-2.0-change-log&quot;&gt;change log&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Student: Alexander Yakushev&lt;br&gt;
Project: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2014/unlogic/5732278101606400&quot;&gt;Lean Clojure/JVM runtime&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this summer I modified Clojure compiler in a separate branch to produce lean bytecode where all Var objects are replaced with static fields of the namespace class. This simultaneously decreased the time required to load the compiled namespace, the memory footprint of that namespace in memory and the added time cost of dereferencing a var each time it is used. The patched compiler also doesn&amp;#39;t emit the bytecode for macros (as they are used only during the macroexpansion and are not needed in runtime) and intelligently elides metadata (so that it is used during compilation but then is not emitted). Some of the observations and thoughts accumulated during this summer were featured in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://clojure-android.info/blog/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; under &amp;quot;gsoc&amp;quot; tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lean compilation is now tested to correctly compile Clojure, core.async and few small libraries. The easiest way to try it out is to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/lein-skummet&quot;&gt;lein-skummet&lt;/a&gt; plugin as described &lt;a href=&quot;http://clojure-android.info/blog/2014/08/12/gsoc-2014-skummet-alpha1/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The compiler was also trialled with Clojure on Android where it showed significant loading time improvements. The easy-to-use way of using lean compilation in CoA will follow soon with the release of the new lein-droid version (and will be announced in the blog).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional resources: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ndr-qef/light-aleph&quot;&gt;README&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/light-table-discussion/gu5RvYS7j94/E7ozA7xJgPYJ&quot;&gt;announcement thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Student: Andrea Marchiori&lt;br&gt;
Project: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2014/ndr_qef/5757334940811264&quot;&gt;Aleph, a BOT browser and introspector for Light Table&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Light Table leverages the BOT architecture to create a platform designed around extensibility. In BOT, working components are defined by several elements. How these elements are combined, how they interact, and how they affect the application state is a source of complexity that makes BOT opaque. Aleph aims to make BOT accessible by providing a uniform interface for querying and recording state at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Student: Di Xu&lt;br&gt;
Project: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2014/xudifsd/5717271485874176&quot;&gt;Typed Clojure: Heterogeneous operations &amp;amp; Dotted Polymorphism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I added two more function type to Typed Clojure, which can be used to annotate some built-in and/or user-defined functions like &lt;code&gt;assoc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;hash-map&lt;/code&gt;. Without those two types, type checking some custom variants accurately becomes impossible without hard-coding each variant into the type checker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve written documentation under doc of my git tree, including document about &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/xudifsd/core.typed/blob/repeat-support/docs/infer-detail.md&quot;&gt;my implementation&lt;/a&gt;, and general &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/xudifsd/core.typed/blob/repeat-support/docs/tutorial-on-inference.md&quot;&gt;introduction&lt;/a&gt; of type inference used in Typed Clojure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also published a &lt;a href=&quot;http://xudifsd.org/blog/2014/08/%E5%85%B3%E4%BA%8Etyped-clojure/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; to introduce Typed Clojure in Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Student: Maksim Karandashov&lt;br&gt;
Project: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2014/norgat/5676830073815040&quot;&gt;Quil on ClojureScript&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quil is a library for creating animated sketches. It is based on a very popular Java library Processing. During this summer I&amp;#39;ve added ClojureScript support to Quil. I used cljx to make Quil crossplatform and Processing.js for ClojureScript version. Current version of Quil allows you to create a sketch that can be run on Clojure or ClojureScript without modifications (or even both using cljx). I&amp;#39;ve also created Processing.js &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/quil/processing-js/tree/master/resources/externs&quot;&gt;externs&lt;/a&gt; for Google Closure Compiler and Leiningen &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/quil/quil-templates&quot;&gt;templates&lt;/a&gt; for Quil (for Clojure and ClojureScript).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information check Quil ClojureScript &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/quil/quil/wiki/ClojureScript&quot;&gt;wiki page&lt;/a&gt; and my &lt;a href=&quot;http://norgat.blogspot.ru/2014/06/alpha-version-of-quil-on-clojurescript.html&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Student: Minori Yamashita&lt;br&gt;
Project: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2014/ympbyc/5676830073815040&quot;&gt;Typed ClojureScript Library Annotations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I added core.typed annotations to cljs.core functions and made some changes to the checker to make them pass. I also started work on TypeScript d.ts to core.typed annotation transpiler and in order to do so I worked on a type called jsnominal to represent TypeScript interface.  I&amp;#39;m willing to continue working on this project but I gotta get myself sorted with the fall semester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Student: Nicola Mometto&lt;br&gt;
Project: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2014/bronsa/5776756782923776&quot;&gt;tools.analyzer extensions: cljs port, documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my GSOC I wrote the tools.analyzer.js contrib library, an analyzer for clojurescript code written on top of the tools.analyzer infrastructure. The advantages tools.analyzer.js has over the default clojurescript analyzer are: increased modularity, simpler implementation, pluggable extension points and an AST format compatible between all the tools.analyzer analyzers (tools.analyzer.jvm is the main one, but a tools.analyzer.clr port is being worked on by David Miller)
making it possible to write analyzer passes that are host agnostic and can work with every tools.analyzer analyzer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also kept on working extensively on all my other contrib libraries, enhancing tools.emitter.jvm and tools.reader and reworking tools.analyzer and thus tools.analyzer.jvm to share as much code/infrastructure as possible with tools.analyzer.js and the AST format has been documented via an AST quickref that can be found in the README of each repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/clojure/tools.emitter.jvm/clojure/Mzakv8NHuO4/RsWeiBdvcz4J&quot;&gt;mail post&lt;/a&gt; describing in detail what has been going on for each project in the last months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usage examples and a detailed changelog can be found in the readme of each repo: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/clojure/tools.reader&quot;&gt;tools.reader&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/clojure/tools.analyzer&quot;&gt;tools.analyzer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/clojure/tools.analyzer.jvm&quot;&gt;tools.analyzer.jvm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/clojure/tools.analyzer.js&quot;&gt;tools.analyzer.js&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/clojure/tools.emitter.jvm&quot;&gt;tools.emitter.jvm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Student: Prasant Chidella&lt;br&gt;
Project: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2014/prasant94/5750085036015616&quot;&gt;Linear Algebra for Clojure – Adding linear algebra tools to core.matrix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I added some linear algebra functions like LU Decomposition, QR decomposition, SVD, least  squares, norm, rank etc. to vectorz which is a Linear algebra library in java. This is the backend for vectorz-clj, one of core.matrix&amp;#39;s implementations. These functions are very close to their counterparts in other java based libraries like EJML, jblas etc in terms of performance, with a lot of scope for optimizations. I also extended &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/java-matrix-benchmark/&quot;&gt;Java matrix benchmark&lt;/a&gt; to run benchmarks for vectorz against the many other libraries like ejml, jama, colt etc. That can be found here: https://github.com/prasant94/JavaMatrixBenchmark-for-Vectorz&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Student: Reid McKenzie&lt;br&gt;
Project: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2014/arrdem/5676830073815040&quot;&gt;Lean Clojure: An agressive compiler for lighter weight Clojure programs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my work on the Oxcart project, I implemented program loading infrastructure to generate a single datastructure representing an entire program and all loaded libraries. I then build analysis infrastructure for examining how definitions in a program are used if they are used and implemented an emitter which where possible would use static function invocation rather than var indirection. The last item I was working on when GSoC ended was AOT compiling all used clojure.core, library and program code to static classes which do not depend on clojure.lang.Compiler and a fork of the Clojure language which breaks the Clojure bootstrapping infrastructure appart from the datastructure libraries. The hope was that Oxcart would be able not only to statically AOT user programs but that by AOTing the Clojure standard library itself that all use of the standard Clojure compiler to generate dynamically linked non-AOT bytecode could be escaped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future of the Oxcart project is uncertain at best, in that I am reluctant to commit to the hard fork of the Clojure language required to support the whole-program AOT work I was contemplating at the end of GSoC. However as whole program compilation of the type that Oxcart was designed for can only be approximated by lazy var loading optimizations and other techniques and as Oxcart demonstrated that speedups of 17-24% are possible using static linking I&amp;#39;m convinced that the Oxcart project itself was a worthwhile experiment forget a facinating summer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Equilibrium</title>
      <description>&lt;h3&gt;Let&amp;#39;s make chaos&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I want to show you a neat chaos simulation. Rules:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;n points on a plane.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each point randomly selects two other points as its leaders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each points tries to get to a position equidistant from both leaders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example for 4 points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/equilibrium/screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;Simulation screenshot&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Green point has 2 leaders - red points. Red line is equidistance line. Green point&amp;#39;s goal is to get and stay on that line. All points have different leaders so movements appear pretty chaotic. Everything stabilizes after a while and we get equilibrium. Now the question: what will happen if you slightly move some point? How long will it take the system to get back into the equilibrium state?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not so profficient in math to describe the system in sophisticated way, but I&amp;#39;m a programmer, so let&amp;#39;s write a simulation using Quil! Quil supports ClojureScript now so sketches can be embedded directly into the page. There will be no source code in this post, only playing with ready-to-use sketches. Link to the source code will be provided at the end of the post. Sketches are desktop-oriented so they probably won&amp;#39;t work propertly on mobiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;First sketch&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;canvas id=&quot;first_sketch&quot; style=&quot;width: 500px; height: 500px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hover th mouse over a point to see it leaders. You also can move a point by dragging it using mouse. Supported keybindings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;space - pause/continue;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;r - regenerate points;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;up and down arrows - increase/decrease number of points and regenerate points;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t forget to empirically get answers to the questions posed earlier. Also check how a configuration consisting only of 3 points always converges to a equilater triangle. Quite nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Second sketch&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while the sketch becomes boring. To make it more dynamic we introduce constant velocity: each point, besides moving towards the equidistance line, also moves constantly in some direction. The direction is chosen randomly and speed is also random. Another change is to make the plane toroidal: if a point goes beyound the left boundary - it will appear on the right, beyound the bottom boundary - will appear on the top. Here is the second sketch that implements all these changes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;canvas id=&quot;second_sketch&quot; style=&quot;width: 500px; height: 500px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we see eternal chaos: points moving around in futile attempt to achieve equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Third sketch&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to to now we&amp;#39;ve seen only points, dull black circles. How about adding tales for points? A tail is a k last positions of a point. And let&amp;#39;s make them colourful because black worms crowling chaotically around the screen is a depressing view. It is worms time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;canvas id=&quot;third_sketch&quot; style=&quot;width: 500px; height: 500px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use left and right arrows to change k - the number of points in tails. These keys work in previous skethes too, so you can turn points into worms there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Where did the simulation come from?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw this simulation on a lecture about artificial intelligence. The simulation was performed on the audience: n people gathered in the center of the room, choosed leaders and started moving. After few minutes everyone finally stopped. Then the lecturer moved one person and everyone had to readjust their positions. It took another few minutes. The lecturer wanted to demonstrate that environment behaves in the same way: if you disbalance some part of it - the whole system will turn into unpredictable chaos. But our simulation shows the opposite: if you try to move a point - it comes back to original position pretty fast while all other points don’t move much. So in ideal conditions the equilibrium is pretty stable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Implementation details&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implementation uses functional-mode middleware and all state updates are handled by Quil (look mom, no atoms!) Another nice thing is that the sketch is fully Clojure and ClojureScript compatible: if you name file equilibrium.clj - you can run in Clojure, rename to equilibrium.cljs, compile and it runs in browser, no change needed! But it&amp;#39;s not ideal. I like to work on a sketch in clojure, which supports live reloading and allows you to change parts of sketch without closing it, but in the end I target ClojureScript (so I can share it in post). It becomes tedious to constantly copy clj to cljs when you change anything and want to check it in browser. I ended up having weird combination of linux &lt;code&gt;watch&lt;/code&gt; command that copies clj to cljs every second and cljsbuild that autocompiles cljs to js. It works but looks ugly and scary. I wonder if it is possible to have a single file which is recognized by Clojure and ClojureScript. I know that I could use cljx for that, but seems quite heavy for such simple task. Or may be I just need to properly setup emacs/cider + cljx integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source code is available on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nbeloglazov/blog-projects/tree/master/equilibrium&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;/scripts/equilibrium.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
    equilibrium.sketch({&quot;host&quot;: &quot;first_sketch&quot;, &quot;tail-size&quot;: 0});
    equilibrium.sketch({&quot;host&quot;: &quot;second_sketch&quot;, &quot;tail-size&quot;: 0, &quot;constant-velocity?&quot;: true, &quot;toroidal-board?&quot;: true});
    equilibrium.sketch({&quot;host&quot;: &quot;third_sketch&quot;, &quot;tail-size&quot;: 15, &quot;colourful?&quot;: true});
&lt;/script&gt;

      <title>Poor Man's Cljsfiddle</title>
      <description>&lt;h3&gt;Intro&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I&amp;#39;ll describe how to create poor man&amp;#39;s cljsfiddle in 4 steps. Rich man&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://cljsfiddle.net/&quot;&gt;cljsfiddle&lt;/a&gt; is a website similar to &lt;a href=&quot;http://jsfiddle.net/&quot;&gt;jsfiddle&lt;/a&gt; which allows you to try and test clojurescript snippets online. It was created by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jonase&quot;&gt;Jonas&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=&quot;http://lispinsummerprojects.org/&quot;&gt;Lisp in Summer Projects&lt;/a&gt; (he took first place!). Cljsfiddle is pretty cool and I encourage you to try it out. But let&amp;#39;s get back to our own cljsfidle. Let&amp;#39;s call it cljsbin to avoid confusion. Cljsbin will have only 3 elements on a page: textarea for writing clojurescript, send button and iframe for running compiled cljs code. Minimalist design for the win!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How it should work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User puts clojurescript to the textarea code and clicks &amp;quot;Send&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A POST &lt;code&gt;/create&lt;/code&gt; request is sent. The request contains cljs source.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The server receives the request, generates unique id for the new snippet, compiles the source and responds with the id.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upon receiving response browser extracts the id and sets &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; attribute of the iframe to &lt;code&gt;/html/ID&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iframe loads html file from the server. The file imports single script file: &lt;code&gt;/js/ID&lt;/code&gt;. The script contains compiled js which is executed inside the iframe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Step 0 - Create Project&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project structure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;├── project.clj
├── src
│   └── cljsbin.clj
└── public
    ├── index.html
    ├── script.js
    └── styles.css
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;project.clj:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-clojure&quot; data-lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;defproject &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;cljsbin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;0.1.0-SNAPSHOT&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:dependencies&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;org.clojure/clojure&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;1.6.0&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
                 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;compojure&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;1.1.8&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
                 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;hiccup&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;1.0.5&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
                 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;ring&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;1.3.0&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
                 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;ring/ring-json&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;0.3.1&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
                 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;org.clojure/clojurescript&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;0.0-2268&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
                 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;me.raynes/fs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;1.4.6&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step 1 - Serve Static Siles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We start by creating a server that does only static files. The server will serve 3 static files: index.html, styles.css and script.js (we need a little bit of js to handle button click).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cljsbin.clj:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-clojure&quot; data-lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;ns &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;cljsbin&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;compojure.core&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:refer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;defroutes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;compojure.route&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:refer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;files&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]]))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;defroutes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; Serve index.html as initial page when user requests&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; http://localhost:8080/&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;slurp &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;public/index.html&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; Serve static files. By default &amp;#39;public&amp;#39; directory is used.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; Example: public/script.js served when user requests&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; http://localhost:8080/script.js&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;files&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;index.html:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Cljsbin&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;/script.js&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;rel=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;stylesheet&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;/styles.css&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/link&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;input-area&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;textarea&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;source&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/textarea&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;send&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Send&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;iframe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;result&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;script.js:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;send&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Not implemented. Wait for the Step 2.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;#send&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;click&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;send&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nbeloglazov/blog-projects/blob/master/cljsbin/public/styles.css&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; styles.css.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run server using jetty:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-clojure&quot; data-lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ring.adapter.jetty/run-jetty&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;cljsbin/app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:port&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;8080&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8080&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8080&lt;/a&gt;, click button and check js console - you should see &amp;quot;Not implemented&amp;quot; message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Step 2 - Serve Iframe Files&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time to serve html and js files which will be loaded by the iframe. Result js file will be static for now as we&amp;#39;re not sending code from the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-clojure&quot; data-lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;ns &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;cljsbin&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;ring.util.response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;resp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;hiccup.page&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:refer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;html5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]]))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; Create response for &amp;quot;/js/ID&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;defn &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;snippet-js&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;str &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;console.log(&amp;#39;I am snippet &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;!&amp;#39;);&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;resp/response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;resp/content-type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;application/javascript&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; Create response for &amp;quot;/html/ID&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;defn &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;snippet-html&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; Html structure is dead simple so it is easier to use hiccup here&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; then load/update html template.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;list &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:head&lt;/span&gt;
             &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;str &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Snippet &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
             &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:script&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:src&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;str &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;/js/&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)}]]&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;html5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;defroutes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;/js/:id&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;snippet-js&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;/html/:id&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;snippet-html&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now reload the server and open &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8080/html/42&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8080/html/42&lt;/a&gt;, you should see blank page and &amp;quot;I am snippet 42!&amp;quot; message in the js console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Step 3 - Implement Send&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re almost there! Let&amp;#39;s implement &lt;code&gt;/create&lt;/code&gt; request now and update js &lt;code&gt;send&lt;/code&gt; function. No cljs-&amp;gt;js compilation yet, just store source and serve it without modification. Format of request (json):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;source&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Some cljs code here.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And response (json):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;12345&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update for cljsbin.clj:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-clojure&quot; data-lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;ns &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;cljsbin&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;compojure.core&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:refer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;defroutes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;ring.middleware.json&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; Save all snippets in an atom. We could use db,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; but we&amp;#39;re doing poor&amp;#39;s man cljsfiddle after all.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; Map structure: id -&amp;gt; js.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;snippets&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;atom&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{}))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; Unique id generator.&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;/html/&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;resp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;#result&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;attr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;src&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m very sorry for using unholy javascript here instead of blessed clojurescript, but I couldn&amp;#39;t make myself setup all cljsbuild stuff for mere 16 lines of js. Now restart the server, but using &lt;code&gt;cljsbin/handler&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;cljsbin/app&lt;/code&gt; this time. Open &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8080&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8080&lt;/a&gt; and try to send following code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;load&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;innerHTML&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;I am alive!&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should see &amp;#39;I am alive!&amp;#39; message in the iframe on the right. We got poor&amp;#39;s man &lt;a href=&quot;http://jsfiddle.net&quot;&gt;jsfiddle&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Step 4 - Clojurescript Compilation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the most interesting part - cljs-&amp;gt; js compilation. Let&amp;#39;s go straight to code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-clojure&quot; data-lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;ns &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;cljsbin&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;cljs.closure&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;cljs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;me.raynes.fs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; Create temp dir where cljs will be compiled.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; It is used to speed up compilation: clojurescript compiler stores&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; intermediate results there. For example cljs.core and clojure.*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; namespaces compiled to js. The directory is optional.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;cljs-compilation-dir&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;fs/temp-dir&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;cljs-compilation&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;defn &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;compile-cljs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; Clojurescript compiler prefers to work with files as&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; input/outputs so we create temp files for the source&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; and compiled output&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;source-file&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;fs/temp-file&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;cljs-source&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;compiled-file&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;fs/temp-file&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;cljs-compiled&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; Write source into the temp file.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;spit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;source-file&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; Compile source using :simple level of optimization.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;cljs/build&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;source-file&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:optimizations&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:simple&lt;/span&gt;
                 &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:output-to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;.getAbsolutePath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;compiled-file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                 &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:output-dir&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;.getAbsolutePath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;cljs-compilation-dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                 &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:pretty-print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; Read compiled output and cleanup temp files.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;compiled&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;slurp &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;compiled-file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;fs/delete&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;source-file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;fs/delete&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;compiled-file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;compiled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; Updated create-snippet&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;defn &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;create-snippet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;next-id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;js&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;compile-cljs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;swap!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;snippets&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;assoc &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;resp/response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restart the server for the last time and try sending cljs code (you might need to wait a little while cljs is compiled):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-clojure&quot; data-lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;ns &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;clojure.browser.dom&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;dom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;defn &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;say-hello&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Hello from ClojureScript!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;dom/element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;dom/append&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;.-body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;js/document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;.addEventListener&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;js/window&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;load&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;say-hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy greetings from clojurescript! Time to create an awesome promo video and launch Kickstarter campaign...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did simple cljsfiddle app in less than 60 lines of clojure code (and 16 lines of javascript), which is pretty cool, I think. Currently I&amp;#39;m working on cljsfiddle-kinda-clone for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/quil/quil&quot;&gt;Quil&lt;/a&gt;: I want to create a website for sharing sketches written in Quil on ClojureScript. And that work inspired me to write this post. Nice thing about using clojurescript compiler is that it is very simple to add support for other cljs libraries when compiling cljs code: just include them into your &lt;code&gt;project.clj&lt;/code&gt; and compiler automatically discovers and compiles them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cljs compilation consists of 2 major steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compile cljs files and their dependencies to separate js files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compile js files to a single js file using &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/&quot;&gt;Google Closure Compiler&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;code&gt;cljs.closure/build&lt;/code&gt; function which does both steps for me. Jonas in his cljsfiddle chose another way: he uses clojurescript compiler to perform only step 1 and then he does step 2 manually: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jonase/cljsfiddle/blob/9565ccf0d256fdbf97bf524dafb499ed470f32cc/src/clj/cljsfiddle/closure.clj#L33&quot;&gt;step 1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jonase/cljsfiddle/blob/9565ccf0d256fdbf97bf524dafb499ed470f32cc/src/clj/cljsfiddle/closure.clj#L47&quot;&gt;step 2&lt;/a&gt;. It allows to perform compilation in memory - no need to use temp files. But it looks more complex. There are most likely other pros, would be glad to hear them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code from this post is available on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nbeloglazov/blog-projects/tree/master/cljsbin&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Clojure Dojo and PubSub</title>
      <description>&lt;h3&gt;Clojure Dojo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Monday I went to a London Clojure Dojo at uSwitch. Dojos are organized beweekly by some companies like ThoughtWorks or uSwitch. Around 10-15 people gather together, order pizza, propose ideas for coding and then split into teams of 3-5 people to code for ~2 hours. After coding part each team gives 5-minutes presentation of what they have done. Main rule (beside &amp;quot;Have fun&amp;quot;) is that each participant must write at least a couple of lines in Clojure during dojo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People coming to dojos have quite different clojure background. Some have been coding clojure for years and use it at work. Some have started learning clojure last week and have written only basic &amp;quot;Hello, world&amp;quot;. Ideas for coding are not very complex, after all you have only 2 hours to code and some people don&amp;#39;t have much experience with clojure. For example at the last dojo we got 5 teams. Two of them were teams of beginners, who worked on exercises from &lt;a href=&quot;http://exercism.io/&quot;&gt;exercism.io&lt;/a&gt;. Two teams tried out &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/clojure/6vDnBWOgHDc&quot;&gt;Quil on ClojureScript&lt;/a&gt;. And finally last team (I was in that team) worked on simple network-level PubSub library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the important issues during the dojo is working environment. A team usually works on a single laptop, because sharing code between several laptops realtime is not an easy task to do. So someone is coding while others discuss and help her/him. One lesson I learned after going to dojos is that editor should be simplest possible. Of course everyone has his/her own favorite setup of emacs/vim/whatever and wants to use it, but it&amp;#39;s a bad idea. I&amp;#39;ve been on some dojos where we were mostly fighting with emacs instead of writing clojure, it was frustrating. Even more, imagine you&amp;#39;re a beginner and you came to a dojo, and now you have to write in language you barely know and use some weird editor which doesn&amp;#39;t behave as normal editors do, double frustrating. So editor should be simple. I think &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lighttable.com/&quot;&gt;LightTable&lt;/a&gt; is the best clojure editor for dojos. It is easy to start, you can write text without twisting your fingers and brain, and finally, it is very easy to execute clojure code, just &amp;quot;Ctrl+Enter&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;d like to describe the project my team worked on at the last dojo: PusSub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;PubSub&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Idea quite simple: write a library which consists of 2 functions: &lt;code&gt;publish&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;subscribe&lt;/code&gt;. It should satisfy following contract:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publishing and subscription are on network level, so each machine gets messages published by other machines on the same network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;publish&lt;/code&gt; takes 1 argument - message. Message is an arbitrary clojure object (string, map, vector, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;subscribe&lt;/code&gt; takes 1 argument - handler function which processes messages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see the library should not have concept of addresses, queues or topics. The library should not have concept of a server: clients should be able to communicate to each other without connecting to some kind of server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For implementation we decided to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_multicast&quot;&gt;IP multicast&lt;/a&gt;. We didn&amp;#39;t dig deep into specification and technical details, just googled how to do it in java. We found &lt;code&gt;java.net.MulticastSocket&lt;/code&gt; class which does exactly what we want. Even more, &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/MulticastSocket.html&quot;&gt;javadoc&lt;/a&gt; for that class contains nice example of how to use it. We translated it into clojure and enhanced a little bit. Here what we got:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-clojure&quot; data-lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;ns &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;pubsub.core&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;java.net&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;InetAddress&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;DatagramPacket&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;MulticastSocket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]))&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; constants specifying multicast address&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;address&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;228.5.6.7&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;port&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;6789&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;group&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;InetAddress/getByName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; function to create new multicast socket&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;defn &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;init-comm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;MulticastSocket.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;.joinGroup&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;group&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; define socket to be used for sending message from current machine&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;init-comm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;defn &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;get-packet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;group&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;DatagramPacket.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;.getBytes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;.length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;group&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; define &amp;#39;publish&amp;#39; function. For some reason we named it &amp;#39;send-it&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;defn &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;send-it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;.send&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;get-packet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;pr-str &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;group&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can publish messages, cool! As you can see we use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/edn-format/edn&quot;&gt;EDN&lt;/a&gt; as format for sending messages (&lt;code&gt;pr-str&lt;/code&gt; converts clojure object to EDN string). Now it is time to implement subscription mechanism. We diverted a little bit from initial goal and implemented more complex subscription model. It has 2 features not mentioned in initial design:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of passing only handler function, we pass 2 functions: predicate and handler. Predicate checks whether message should be processed and if it returns true then handler is invoked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initial design doesn&amp;#39;t have a mechanism to unsubscribe handler. We added it. When you subscribe, a promise object is created. The promise is used as finished flag: subscription halts once someone delivered anything into the promise. The promise is returned from &lt;code&gt;subscribe&lt;/code&gt; function so user can put any value to it to unsubscribe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-clojure&quot; data-lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; &amp;#39;process-message&amp;#39; is a recursive function used to process messages&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; Parameters&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;;   socket - socket object to receive message from&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;;   predicate - user-provided function which decides whether process message or not&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;;   handler - user-provided function which processes message&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;;   finished - promise which indicates when to unsubscribe&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;defn &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;process-message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;predicate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;handler&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;finished&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;size&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;packet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;DatagramPacket.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;byte-array&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;when-not &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;realized?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;finished&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;.receive&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;packet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;packet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;.getData&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;String.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;read-string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;when &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;predicate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;handler&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))))&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;recur&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;predicate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;handler&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;finished&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; &amp;#39;subscribe&amp;#39; function. Again, we named it differently :)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; It has 2 versions, first is classic, takes only handler.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; Second version takes predicate and handler.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;defn &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;subscribe-with&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;handler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;subscribe-with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;constantly &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;handler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;predicate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;handler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;init-comm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;finished&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;future&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;process-message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;predicate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;handler&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;finished&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;.leaveGroup&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;group&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;finished&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all. The library is ready to use. Here is how to use it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-clojure&quot; data-lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;pubsub.core&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:refer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;send-it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;subscribe-with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]])&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; subscribe to all messages&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;subscribe-with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;println &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Simplest subscribe&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; send message, we should see it printed in console&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;send-it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;something&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; subscripe only to messages which are maps and contain topic == :dojo&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;subscribe-with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;= &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:topic&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:dojo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;println &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Dojo message&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; subscribe only to messages with topic :work&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;subscribe-with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;= &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:topic&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:work&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;println &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Work message&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; subscript only to messages with topic :home&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;subscribe-with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;= &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:topic&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;println &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Home message&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; send messages with different topics&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;send-it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:topic&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:dojo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Hello, clojurians!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;send-it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:topic&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:work&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re at work...&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;send-it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:topic&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:home&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re at home...&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can built something else on top of the library, for example decentralized chat app or simple multiplayer game. Who knows, it might make a nice project for another dojo.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Quil: Age of Middleware</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quil 2.1.0 introduced new feature: middleware. Middleware is a way to augment a sketch without blowing up your code, you can think of it as a way to create &amp;quot;libraries&amp;quot; for Quil. Idea is similar to the ring middleware: Quil middleware is a regular clojure function which takes map of sketch options and returns updated map, that&amp;#39;s all. What can we do in a middleware? Well, a lot of things, middleware has full power over options so we can wrap functions like &lt;code&gt;draw&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;setup&lt;/code&gt; and others user-provided functions anyway we want. As an example let&amp;#39;s create a middleware which rotates sketch on each frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Rotating middleware&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rotating middleware&amp;#39;s job is pretty simple: replace user-provided &lt;code&gt;draw&lt;/code&gt; function with it own special version of &lt;code&gt;draw&lt;/code&gt;. This special &lt;code&gt;draw&lt;/code&gt; function does two things: first, it rotates sketch some angle, and second, calls original &lt;code&gt;draw&lt;/code&gt;. But code is worth a thousand words, so here it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-clojure&quot; data-lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; rotated-draw is the special draw function,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; which rotates sketch some angle depending on current frame number,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; and then calls original user-provided &amp;#39;draw&amp;#39; function.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; period is a number of frames to rotate sketch a full 360 degrees&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;defn &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;rotating-draw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;period&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;orig-draw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; calculate angle to rotate using handy map-range function&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;angle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;q/map-range&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;mod&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;q/frame-count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;period&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                           &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;period&lt;/span&gt;
                           &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;q/TWO-PI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;center-x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;/ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;q/width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;center-h&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;/ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;q/height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; we want to rotate sketch relative to the center of screen&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; so we need to move the origin point first and only then rotate&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;q/with-translation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;center-x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;center-y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; rotate screen given angle&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;q/with-rotation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;angle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; move origin back to the left top corner (default position)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; our middleware should be transparent to the user so we don&amp;#39;t&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; want to change any default settings&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;q/with-translation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;- &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;center-x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;- &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;center-y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; call user-provided &amp;#39;draw&amp;#39; function&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;orig-draw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))))))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; the middleware function&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; it is a regular clojure function&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;defn &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;rotate-me&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; user-provided &amp;#39;draw&amp;#39; or empty function if it&amp;#39;s not present&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:draw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;options&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fn &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]))&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;period&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; replace user-provided draw with&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; our custom rotating &amp;#39;draw&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;assoc &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:draw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;partial &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;rotating-draw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;period&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; and here how we use it&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;q/defsketch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;my-sketch&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:draw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:size&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;500&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:middleware&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;rotate-me&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s check now if it works. Here is a boring static image of nested squares:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/quil-middleware/rect-static.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Static squares&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It starts rotating after applying &lt;code&gt;rotate-me&lt;/code&gt; middleware:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/quil-middleware/rect-rotating.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Static squares&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say we want to change rotation period now. We can always modify &lt;code&gt;rotate-me&lt;/code&gt; function and change period there. But that&amp;#39;s not very customizable, what if user wants to change it? We don&amp;#39;t want user to dive into middleware and modify it. Even more, middleware may be shipped as a library and modifying a third-party library is not an easy task. Fortunately our problem is easy to solve: let&amp;#39;s read rotation period from &lt;code&gt;options&lt;/code&gt; map:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-clojure&quot; data-lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;defn &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;rotate-me&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:draw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;options&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fn &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]))&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; read period as :rotate-period value&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; or fallback to 200 if not provided&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;period&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:rotate-period&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;options&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;assoc &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:draw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;partial &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;rotated-draw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;period&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; customize period in defsketch&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;q/defsketch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;my-sketch&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:draw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:size&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:middleware&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;rotate-me&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:rotate-period&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t show rotating squares gif here again, it is just rotating twice as fast as original, so there is no point of repeating it. Instead let&amp;#39;s rotate animation of bouncing ball. Before:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/quil-middleware/ball-static.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Static ball&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/quil-middleware/ball-rotating.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Static rotating&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With middleware it becomes easier to write pluggable extensions for Quil. It&amp;#39;s easy to share middleware with other users - you need to provide a single function which everyone can add to their &lt;code&gt;:middleware&lt;/code&gt; option and it works!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quil already uses middleware internally: there is a &lt;code&gt;safe-fn&lt;/code&gt; middleware which wraps all user-provided handlers, so exceptions thrown inside them are not propagated outside. It allows user to fix broken handler on fly without need to restart the sketch. The other middleware is &lt;code&gt;deprecated-options&lt;/code&gt; which checks if some of the options are deprecated and prints info to console. Along with middleware, Quil 2.1.0 introduced &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/quil/quil/wiki/Functional-mode-%28fun-mode%29&quot;&gt;functional mode&lt;/a&gt;, which itself is a middleware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some links:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Code from this post is available on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nbeloglazov/blog-projects/tree/master/quil-age-of-middleware&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Quil Intro</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is an introductory post about Quil. Quil is an interactive animation library for clojure. Simply speaking it allows you to draw whatever you want on a rectangular window. Quil provides tons of useful functions for drawing in 2D and 3D. In this post I will show how to create and run Quil sketches. Let&amp;#39;s start with something simple: with trigonometry... Everyone loves trigonometry: sine, cosine, tangent, what can be better? Our first sketch will draw a spiral using sin and cos functions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;project.clj&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-clojure&quot; data-lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;defproject &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;quil-intro&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;0.1.0-SNAPSHOT&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:dependencies&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;org.clojure/clojure&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;1.6.0&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
                 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;quil&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;2.2.2&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;quil_intro.clj:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-clojure&quot; data-lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;ns &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;quil-intro&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;quil.core&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; define function which draws spiral&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;defn &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; make background white&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;q/background&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; move origin point to centre of the sketch&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; by default origin is in the left top corner&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;q/with-translation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;/ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;q/width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;/ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;q/height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; parameter t goes 0, 0.01, 0.02, ..., 99.99, 100&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;doseq &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;range &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.01&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; draw a point with x = t * sin(t) and y = t * cos(t)&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;q/point&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;* &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;q/sin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;* &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;q/cos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))))))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; run sketch&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;q/defsketch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;trigonometry&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:size&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;300&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;300&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:draw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see for basic sketch we need to define a &lt;code&gt;draw&lt;/code&gt; function which, well, draws something. Then we call &lt;code&gt;defsketch&lt;/code&gt; passing &lt;code&gt;draw&lt;/code&gt; function to it. Here is the image drawn by our code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/quil-intro/spiral.png&quot; alt=&quot;Plot of spiral&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beautiful, isn&amp;#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;#39;s refactor &lt;code&gt;draw&lt;/code&gt; function making plotting functions easier. To achieve this we&amp;#39;ll define &lt;code&gt;draw-plot&lt;/code&gt; function which takes a parametric function &lt;em&gt;f(t) = (x, y)&lt;/em&gt; , ranges for parameter &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; and plots given function over given range. Here is refactored code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-clojure&quot; data-lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; define f&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;defn &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;* &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;q/sin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;* &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;q/cos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))])&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;defn &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;draw-plot&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;step&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;doseq &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;two-points&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;range &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;step&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                          &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;map &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                          &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;partition&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; we could use &amp;#39;point&amp;#39; function to draw a point&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; but let&amp;#39;s rather draw a line which connects 2 points of the plot&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;apply &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;q/line&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;two-points&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;defn &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;q/background&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;q/with-translation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;/ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;q/width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;/ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;q/height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;draw-plot&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.01&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cool, now we can experiment with &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; by changing it in any way we&amp;#39;d like. And here comes real beauty of Quil: live reloading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Live Reloading.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we changed code we don&amp;#39;t need to close sketch, recompile everything and start sketch again as we would do in most other languages. In quil we can update all functions on the fly and see results immediately. In fact we can program whole sketch from the beginning to the end without ever closing it. Of course there are some things we can&amp;#39;t do on the fly. We can&amp;#39;t register mouse and keyboard listeners on the fly, but we still can update already registered. Now let&amp;#39;s get back to work and update &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-clojure&quot; data-lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; you can get awesome plots using random combinations of trigonometric functions&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; here f which plots a flower&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;defn &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;* &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;q/sin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;q/cos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;* &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;q/sin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;* &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;* &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;q/cos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;* &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)))]))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we need to reload updated &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;. Standard clojure techniques can be used to do it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emacs: &lt;code&gt;C-x C-e&lt;/code&gt; to reload &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LightTable: &lt;code&gt;Ctrl+Enter&lt;/code&gt; to reload &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;REPL: redefine &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here is the flower (together with some other plots of random functions):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/quil-intro/flower.png&quot; alt=&quot;Plot of spiral&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/quil-intro/water-drop.png&quot; alt=&quot;Plot of water drop&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/quil-intro/leaf.png&quot; alt=&quot;Plot of leaf&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/quil-intro/crazy-lines.png&quot; alt=&quot;Plot of crazy lines&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Animation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we&amp;#39;ll look at another quil feature. Up to this point we drew static images which weren&amp;#39;t changing over time. But in fact &lt;code&gt;draw&lt;/code&gt; function is called repeatedly in short intervals. That means we can draw moving objects and do real animation! Let&amp;#39;s modify our sketch so on each iteration only a part of a plot is drawn: line from &lt;em&gt;f(t)&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;f(t+1)&lt;/em&gt;. The only problem is that &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; should change on each iteration, to solve it we&amp;#39;ll use &lt;a href=&quot;http://quil.info/environment.html#frame-count&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;frame-count&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which returns current iteration number and we can use this number as &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;. Here is implementation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-clojure&quot; data-lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;defn &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;q/with-translation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;/ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;q/width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;/ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;q/height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; note that we don&amp;#39;t use draw-plot here as we need&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; to draw only small part of a plot on each iteration&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;/ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;q/frame-count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;q/line&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;+ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))))))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; &amp;#39;setup&amp;#39; is a cousin of &amp;#39;draw&amp;#39; function&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; setup initialises sketch and it is called only once&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; before draw called for the first time&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;defn &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;setup&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; draw will be called 60 times per second&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;q/frame-rate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; set background to white colour only in the setup&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; otherwise each invocation of &amp;#39;draw&amp;#39; would clear sketch completely&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;q/background&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;q/defsketch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;trigonometry&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:size&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;300&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;300&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:setup&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;setup&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:draw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time for animation!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/quil-intro/animation.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Animation of leaf plot&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All our sketches are black and white. It would be nice to add some colours. I&amp;#39;ll leave it as exercise to reader, or, if you&amp;#39;re too lazy, you can simply check GitHub repo in the end of this post. Here is what I came up with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/quil-intro/animation-color.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Colourful animation of flower plot&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s it for today. Some final notes: Quil is based on Processing programming language, which is itself wonderful language/program for creating visual arts, but Quil moves it to the next level with live reloading (the same could be said about general programming and clojure). It is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; cool to be able to reload parts of your sketch on fly and get immediate feedback. It boosts your experimentation velocity so I would definitely encourage everyone to play with it. Here is some useful links related to this post:&lt;/p&gt;
